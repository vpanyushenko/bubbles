        <p>
          A Modal is basically a card that will sit on top of all content. It should only be used for actions that to
          user needs to take right now.
        </p>

        <p>
          Modals are set programmatically. Add the <code>Modal</code> component to your <code>__layout.svelte</code>
          file, and then use the helper functions <code>showModal</code> to bring up the modal. The
          <code>showModal</code>
          function will add the required components to a the <code>modalStore</code>. You can also programmatically hide
          the modal using the <code>hideModal</code> function.
        </p>

        <p>Generally, your modal will display a form or a message to the user with some buttons.</p>
