**prefix_options** `array<Object>`<br>
This takes the same properties as the options array above. The difference is that the options passed in here will be added to the front of the list.

The reason that you may want to do things this way is because when you fetch data from an API, you might already have an array. In that case you would typically just `map` over the array to create the options.

However, if you're building some kind of filter, you might want to add some additional options like "All", "None", etc. In that case, it's a little annoying to add those to your array and you get extra code, it's sloppy, and typescript will yell at you. You end up with a lot of JS in your `script` tag just to format the options.

So this will let you add those manual, handcrafted options.

---

**value** `boolean`<br>
If the component is checked or not.

---

**label** `string` <br>
The label you want explaining what the checkbox is.

---

**desc** `string` <br>
The option to add more text to explain the option the user is selecting in more detail. This element allows you to include html elements, so you can add an outbound link with an anchor tag.

---

**error** `string` <code class="blue">An error occurred</code><br>
The error text you want to show if this item fails validation.

---

**validation** `string`<br>
The validation string you want to use for this form. See [validateInputs](/validate-inputs) for more information.

---

**type** `string` <code class="blue">select</code><br>
The default type is select but if it's really important for you to have values that are numbers, you can change the type to `select-number`.

---

**validate_on_blur** `boolean` <br>
If true, runs the validation checks when focus is lost from the input.

---

**search** `boolean` <br>
If you want the select element to be searchable. By default, if you have more than 5 options, the search will be turned on. You can override this behavior if you want to.

---

**search_threshold** `number` <code class="blue">0.3</code> <br>
How strict you want the search to be. A number of 0 would mean an exact match while 1 would be a very lax match that would max everything

---

**onselect** `function(value)` <br>
A function that will fire every time an item is selected. The function will be provided one argument, which will be the value of the value of the selected option.
